### Why this repository ? 
GitHub made for the Project : **"Built your own thermodynamics sea ice model"** of the LPHYS2265 class. In this repository a Multi-Model Analysis is perform based on 15 models with CTL (Control) run and 14 models with PR (Projection) run.
The goal with this analysis is to give an answer to these **two scientific questions :**

- **Will there be more or less Arctic sea ice at the end of this century? (why? what does it depend on?)**
- **In which season the Arctic sea ice decrease will be the largest? (why? what does it depend on?)**

The final report around these questions and the analysis can be found in the *report.pdf* file. This project has been done by Augustin Lambotte and Amaury Laridon.
